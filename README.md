## Steven Aranibar's Cloud Journey

If you haven't checked out my first #100DaysOfCloud git repo, then please do! I cover many aspects of linux needed to pass the LFCS, and now I turn my attention to getting CKA certified and landing my first DevOps/ cloud engineer role in Toronto.

The ideal outcome would be AWS CCP and CKA certified by end of year, and my first cloud role landed by end of Jan. 

(Jan 1st 2021 update): I am AWS CCP certified!

(Feb 8th 2021 update): I begin my first day as an Associate Cloud Operations Engineer at Cloudreach! :)

See the first repo [here](https://github.com/AbstractFuture/100DaysOfCloud).

Happy to have you on this journey with me!

Keep learning. Never give up. 100 days just might change your life!
