# Study/ Application/ Networking Plan (& Toronto TD Cloud Architect Feedback)

## Introduction

I've put together a study plan for the day regarding the AWS CCP and which resources I'll be consulting.

I'm finishing up a job application task list which I expect to complete by end of day.

Lastly, I've recently gotten some feedback about cloud architect roles in Toronto at TD which I'll be sharing with you all below. 

## Study Plan

Study plan and resources are as follows;
- review Stephane Maarek's Udemy course for AWS CCP, specifically around security and S3
- begin using Neal Davis' practice test
- complete AWS official practice test either today or tomorrow

## Job Application Plan

- apply to 2 cloud roles, and customize the resume for both of these applications

## Networking Plan

- reach out to five cloud engineers in the GTA and learn more about what remote work and career growth looks like at their companies

## Toronto TD Cloud Architect Feedback

While doing the above networking plan yesterday, I got the following feedback:

 "TD Architects have average 15 years + Architect Experience must have TOGAF 9 and our main public cloud is Azure  you must have AZ900 or Az304  at a min. -  we do AWS only as SaaS model via 3rd party  vendor and not direct IaaS or PaaS"

It appears to me this was a nice way to say I'm underqualified, since he addressed neither what remote work or career growth looked like at TD. That being said, he did help me understand what I should be orienting myself towards in the future.

## Next Steps

- studying for aws ccp
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
