# Terraform Project Selection

## Introduction

If you have been following this git repo for the last two weeks or so then you know I've been building out small scale but practical Terraform projects. I find that now in interviews I'm being asked for more technical depth in my Terraform projects and I need to decide on a more difficult TF configuration to impress interviewers.

## Project Selection

This list is not definite and I am open to suggestions.

Right now I'm deciding on doing both, but curious as to which will be faster to complete.

- hosting a static website on an s3 bucket
- created a custom vpc with 4 subnets (2 public and 2 private) that will have a pair of public/private in specific availability zones

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
    - continue Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.
