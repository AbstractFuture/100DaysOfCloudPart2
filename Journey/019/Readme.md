# Study Plan, Jobs, & Linkedin Setbacks

## Study Plan

- Complete all Neal Davis practice exams (should be completed within a day)
- Spend 1 hour building out my AWS re/START project portfolio (spending one hour per day should, in my estimation, allow me to complete it within 30 days)

## Jobs

- Apply to 3 cloud roles with customized resumes

## Linkedin Setbacks

Ah, Linkedin. Sometimes you are not clear with your offerings.

I recently hit the commercial limit for browsing profiles. This seems reasonable, since I was reaching out to cloud engineers within Toronto and asking for resume feedback, what growth looked like at their companies, what they thought of remote work post covid lockdown, etc. However, what is unreasonable, is that after being prompted to upgrade to premium (which I did), the commercial limit is not reset. 

Wait, what? So I'm explicitly told to upgrade, to unlock this feature again, and after buying the feature is still not available? Not only this, but if it is only certain tiers of the premium plans that would offer this, why not say so up front?

After reaching out via chat, the chat timedout and prompted me to file a ticket, which was unavailable because linkedin was experiencing higher than normal support requests? 

Will linkedin go broke without my money? I doubt it. But isn't the whole silicon valley culture about creating good experiences? This needs to be improved. 

## Next Steps

- studying for aws ccp
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
