# Tooling + ServiceNow Training + AZ-104

## Introduction

Today I got another overview of the tooling my team uses for automated patching of instances, responding to ServiceNow Tickets, and some upskilling in my day.

Definitely excited to start patching instances on my own within the next couple of weeks! Training/ onboarding is coming to a close and the training wheels will soon be off. Awesome!
