# My First Day (Again!)

## Introduction

If you haven't checked out my first #100DaysOfCloud git repo, then please do! I cover many aspects of linux needed to pass the LFCS, and now I turn my attention to getting CKA certified and landing my first DevOps role in Toronto.

The ideal outcome would be AWS CCP and CKA certified by end of year, and my first devops role landed by end of Jan. 

See the first repo [here](https://github.com/AbstractFuture/100DaysOfCloud).

Happy to have you on this journey with me!

Keep learning. Never give up. 100 days just might change your life!

## Try yourself

I highly recommend you clone a copy of the original #100DaysOfCloud template and get started on your journey! Being held accountable goes a long way when it comes to self motivation.

## Next Steps

Continue my CKA certification journey.
