# Sorted List of HV Cloud Tasks (Jan 2021)

## Introduction

I've reorganized my list of daily/ weekly/ monthly priorities. 

More emphasis on producing revenue, less emphasis on cool things that capture my interest.

## High Value Tasks (Jan 2021)

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.


## Next Steps

- build out serverless aws project
- build out terraform project
    - I should turn this project into a multicloud project!
- select and built out ansible project
- review list of questions asked in the technical interview for studying
    - research one thoroughly and practice answer
- send out resume; schedule cloud interview
- complete python devops assessments
    - review current python solution
        - add additional test cases so I can determine if my solution is hard coded or properly algorithmic
    - review other python tutorials
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
    - may need to push this back based on whether or not I find work by end of Jan 2021
- begin Aaron Brooks' pipelines and horizons bootcamp on Jan 4th
- ????
- profit
