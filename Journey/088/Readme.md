# Writing Documentation

## Introduction

Today I had the chance to write an RFC (request for chaneg) in service now. 

I have so much more appreciation for well written documentation after writing some of my own. 

When writing, I always tried to keep in mind that this documentation has to be easily understood for people with perhaps little exposure to the topic in question. I can't assume they have in depth knowledge of the subject matter (which was Azure in this instance), and I need to give the reader the tools and trouble shooting steps to solve the problem with very little or no room for ambiguity. An excellent exercise.

2) Daily Practice
    - Azure labs
