# Adding HackerRank Into The Mix

## The New Study Plan (work in progress)

I'll be adding hacker rank into how I practice python for devops, starting with semantic basics.

It is my understanding that Python acts as the glue between many devops components, so having some sharp python skills would be useful for me during interviews.

Aside from the study plan, I'm still elated about becomming AWS Cloud Practitioner certified. Excited to continue on this journey!

## Next Steps

- complete python devops assessments
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again (mid january perhaps)
- ????
- profit
