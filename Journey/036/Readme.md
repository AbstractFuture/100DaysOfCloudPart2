# Python For DevOps Code Revisions (& other misc. items)

## Introduction

While I solved a sorted array problem with python about 2 days ago, I got some friendly feedback strongly suggesting to add comments in (so that I won't forget what the code does) and to revise my function such that no answer is hard coded and such that my function can handle new test cases. I'm one step closer to paid work! 

I'll be spending some more time today adding in new test cases and revising the function.

## Misc. Task List

- reach out to 10 hiring managers who are looking for cloud engineers
- spend 1 hr working with terraform
- spend 1 hr working with flask and docker
- review technical interview questions and learn how to answer them better

## Next Steps

- build out serverless aws project
- build out terraform project
    - I should turn this project into a multicloud project!
- select and built out ansible project
- review list of questions asked in the technical interview for studying
    - research one thoroughly and practice answer
- send out resume; schedule cloud interview
- complete python devops assessments
    - review current python solution
        - add additional test cases so I can determine if my solution is hard coded or properly algorithmic
    - review other python tutorials
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
    - may need to push this back based on whether or not I find work
- begin Aaron Brooks' pipelines and horizons bootcamp on Jan 4th
- ????
- profit
