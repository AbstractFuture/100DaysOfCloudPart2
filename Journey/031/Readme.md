# Cloud Study Plan - Remainder of 2020

## Introduction

The next few days before 2021 will be busy. I have a confirmed technical interview and a pre-screen interview with another company that will be scheduled before the new year.

In addition, I have personal projects and general studying to do.

## Interview #1 prep

- review aws services and microsoft cloud offerings
- prepare list of questions for interviewers
    - must not forget to ask what the next steps/timeline looks like (i.e. how soon will I hear back with acceptance or rejection)

## Interview #2 pre-screen phone chat

Not sure what to expect. The recruiter is from an agency working on behalf of the client. Don't know who the client is yet or what the company culture looks like. If it was anything like the last phone screen it will involve some technical linux and AWS questions to verify if I'm a candidate for a more detailed tech interview.

## Personal Projects

Now that the AWS re/START cloud bootcamp has concluded (and I got AWS Cloud Practioner Certified!), it may be worthwhile to build a quick Terraform project over the next 2 days since I'm getting technical interviews. 

There are valid reasons why a company uses a multi-cloud environment. For example, company A could have bought company B which uses a different cloud vendor, or perhaps company A needed to create a feature which was easier to do in a different cloud vendor. Either way, being able to speak intelligently about the use cases for Terraform will be positive in an interview. 

## General Studying

Definitely will be spending another hour trying to pass my python DevOps test cases. The sooner I can land some freelance contracts, the better.

## Next Steps

- prep for technical interview
    - go through bookmarks for technical interview bookmarks
    - review aws services and projects
    - review microsoft services
- complete python devops assessments
    - complete more HackerRank challenges
    - review other python tutorials
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
- ????
- profit
