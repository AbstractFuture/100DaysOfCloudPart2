# Learning Azure From Scratch

## Introduction

Using my acloudguru subscription, provided by my new workplace, I started working towards my AZ-104 (Azure Administrator Associate). 

During the first few lectures, it was clear I needed to at least get familiar with Azure fundamentals first so I started learning more about the Azure platform from acloudguru's AZ-900 lectures.

## AZ-900

I find a lot of the concepts covered here (such as on demand pricing and other business advanatges) overlap with the AWS CCP.

The acloudguru AZ-900 lectures are good at giving you an overview of the services offered by azure and how they fit together to create solutions for customers.

Overall it was a productive day of learning.
