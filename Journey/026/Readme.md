# Python Challenge #1 Solved - & Other Misc. Tasks

## Introduction

Yesterday I completed my first python challenge, which involved new things I had never done!
- unit testing with pytest and passing 6 test cases
- creating and using python virtual environments

Today I'll be continuing the remaining python challenges and completing HackerRank challenges. Practice makes perfect!

## Misc. Tasks

- send out 1 custom resume

## Try yourself

This python challenge is regarded as basic, so if you struggle with it please review your python fundamentals! 

Write a function that selects the maximum value from an array of integers. Do not use any built-in max functions. select_max([1, 2, 3, 4]) -> 4

Your function should return a None type if the array is empty. Good luck!

## Next Steps

- complete python devops assessments
    - complete more HackerRank challenges
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
- ????
- profit
