# AZ-900 Practice Tests

## Introduction

Today I finished the acloudguru AZ-900 Practice tests. I'll be redoing these practice tests until I score 90% or more and then begin on the AZ-104 lectures on acloudguru.

## Task List

- do practice exams
    - take notes on which area I did the worst
    - review my weakest areas first
- move onto studying for the AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate
    - I don't expect to move onto the AZ-104 today

## Next Steps

1) Continue Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs
    - AZ 104 (Azure Administrator)
3) Daily Practice
    - Azure labs
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
