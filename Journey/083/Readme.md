# AWS CloudTrail Troubleshooting

## Introduction

Spent most of today sorting through AWS S3 policy docs to solve the following issue: Cloudtrail should automatically apply a policy to the bucket, yet the action is denied.

I suspect I'll need to send another half day figuring out why my role, which I've verified has the correct permissions, won't apply the SCP.
