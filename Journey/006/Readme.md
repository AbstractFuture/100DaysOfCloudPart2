# Reorganizing Tasks (Focus On Getting Hired)

## Introduction

I'm juggling my time between 3 main areas right now;
- building devops projects
- passing the cka
- passing the aws ccp

As of this week I've decided to reorganize my approach based on 2 things:
- the aws re/start program is quickly coming to a close and I'd like to keep the program schedule timeline
- while passing the cka and aws ccp are useful, my resume still lacks a project and I believe I could go to market faster if I had at least one project under my belt

## Prerequisite

For the aws ccp;
- know the services and do practice tests prior to signing up

For the cka;
- finish kode klouds cka specific exam prep before taking the exam

For the devops project;
- begin this weekend. No excuses

## Cloud Research

I think the biggest shift in my plan has been the order in which I accomplish things. After further reflection, I could go to market faster by having at least one cloud project on the resume. 

I believe the cloud project and current level of education I have should be able to get me in the door of interviewers. I have confidence I can sell myself well in the interview which, in my opinion, would influence their consideration of me more strongly than currently having the certs.

Long story short; build project, immediately begin cold calling and reaching out, get aws ccp, and get cka.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I should be employed faster with this new strategy. Time will tell. 

## Next Steps

- begin and complete cloud/ devops projects
- study for and pass the aws ccp
- speedrun all previous cka labs
- finish CKA security labs
- complete all cka content
- pass cka

## Social Proof
