# AWS Services & Technical Recruiter Feedback

## Introduction

I'm more than half way through Stephane Maarek's Udemy course, and we've covered the basics of:
- IAM roles
- ec2 and its different pricing options
- EBS (ec2 instance storage)
- load balancers and auto scaling groups
- s3 storage
- databases and analytics
- other compute services (ECS, Lambda, Batch, Lightsail)
- deployments and managing infrastructure at scale (SSM, cloudformation, opsworks)
- aws global infrastructure

## Cloud Research

Remaining topics include:
- cloud integrations
- cloud monitoring
- VPC & networking
- security
- machine learning
- account management and billing
- advanced identity
- AWS architecting ecosystem

Definitely looking forward to finishing up his course this weekend. I've already thought of a few new project ideas to add to my portfolio of work. I'm toying around with some cloudformation project ideas and some serverless ones. 

If you're already working with serverless, feel free to reach out to me! I'd love to hear more about it from you.

On Friday I also had an interview with a specialized technical recruiting firm which places experienced devops engineers. While I was clearly well below the years of experience they generally look for, they still had the meeting with me and gave me useful feedback about my resume and the toronto market. 

Resume feedback:
Very compelling resume. They complimented the way I demonstrated how my non tech roles would contribute to me working in tech. For example, when I was studying sql, python, or devops while working in marketing, I explicitly mentioned the hours per week dedicated to building tech projects and learning. 

Toronto devops market feedback:
Generally companies want a new hire to have a few years of devops experience. This probably means I need to start in a cloud engineer role first.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

At the end of this weekend I should be easily passing all of Stephane's end of lecture quizzes. Depending on how good my AWS re/START practice quiz score is, I can move onto other cloud projects.

## Next Steps

- studying for aws ccp
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
