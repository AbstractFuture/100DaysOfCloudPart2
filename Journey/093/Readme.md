# AWS Support + Terraform Training

## Introduction

Today I was job shadowing a few team mates and joined in on an AWS support call. We were having some issues making changes on the instance and our AWS support engineer walked us through a few hours of troubleshooting. 

I had to jump off the call to join a terraform training (which was dope) but I need to check in w/ the team and see if this was resolved or not.

Overall: a pretty cool day.
