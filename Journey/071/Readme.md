# Hit The Ground Running - Learning Path On The First Day!

## Introduction

My first day in my first cloud role (Associate cloud operations engineer! How cool is that?) was great. 

I am a constant learner and I wanted a company that really valued that. I can now confidently say that Cloudreach is definitely that place. My manager laid out the certification learning path I need to do and the timeline I need to do it in. I like the directness! Really excited to keep learning.

## Azure Certs

The first cert I need to get is the AZ 104 - The azure administrator cert. Let's get it! Cloudreach has a subsription to acloudguru and I started the learning path as of yesterday to do the AZ 104 lectures and labs.

Really excited that I get to be multi cloud :)
