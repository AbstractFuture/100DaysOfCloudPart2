# Terraform on AWS

## Introduction

Today I installed Terraform, spun up an ec2 instance, made changes to the terraform config and deployed those changes. Wrapped up by destroying the infrastructure provisioned by Terraform. Very excited to keep going!

## Use Case

Several Toronto technical recruiters and Toronto based senior cloud engineers have explained to me that Terraform skills are in demand. I may even need to prioritize this cert over the CKA. 

## Misc. Task List

- reach out to 10 hiring managers who are looking for cloud engineers
- spend 1 hr working with terraform
- spend 1 hr solving python array problems
    - maybe an additional hour on HackerRank
- review technical interview questions and learn how to answer them better

## Next Steps

- build out serverless aws project
- build out terraform project
    - I should turn this project into a multicloud project!
- select and built out ansible project
- review list of questions asked in the technical interview for studying
    - research one thoroughly and practice answer
- send out resume; schedule cloud interview
- complete python devops assessments
    - review current python solution
        - add additional test cases so I can determine if my solution is hard coded or properly algorithmic
    - review other python tutorials
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
    - may need to push this back based on whether or not I find work by end of Jan 2021
- begin Aaron Brooks' pipelines and horizons bootcamp on Jan 4th
- ????
- profit
