# Tooling & Job Shadowing

## Introduction

Today (well not just today, several times this week and last week, but in particular today), I was job shadowing an experienced cloud ops engineer and seeing how they navigated their workflow, and how they patched instances and communicated w/ customers.

Definitely a cool experience. I'm a fan of this 'over-the-shoulder' approach, and I wish that the companies I used to work for in advertising did something similar for new hires. It is such a cool and useful experience to see trouble shooting in real time, seeing the questions an experienced cloudops engineer asks, and seeing how efficiently they solve complex tasks. I love it.
