# Application Lifecycle & Cluster Maintenance

## Introduction

I finished up the application lifecycle CKA content and I'm making progress in the cluster maintenance labs. I hope that I'll move onto the security section, assuming I am more competent at speedrunning the previous labs.

## Prerequisite

Some basic knowledge of kubernetes is preferred.

## Cloud Research

Some things I struggle with;
- knowing when to solve a problem with imperative commands vs creating the yaml file and editing it
- recalling syntax
- solving problems quickly

Some things I'm good with;
- not giving up
- repeating past labs
- looking up things in the documentation when I don't know the answer as opposed to spending 30 mins trying to solve a simple problem


Topics covered in the cluster maintenance labs;
- OS upgrades (I will definitely need to practice this more. The documentation is too wordy and I wasn't succesful. I had to use the kode kloud video solutions, not the official documentation)
- cluster upgrades
- backup and restore methods

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I'm nearly 50% through the CKA study content! At this rate I'll not only complete the study labs, but have time to go through the exam prep multiple times so that I'm ready on Dec 5th for the exam.

## Next Steps

- move onto CKA security labs
- complete all cka content
- pass cka
- study for and pass the aws ccp
