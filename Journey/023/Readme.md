# Being AWS Certified & Other Neat Things

## Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner

Overall, a good experience. Eager to get started with things in production. 

Personally I found Neal Davis' written English questions to be of higher quality and clarity than Stephane Maarek's Udemy course but both were useful in passing.

## Other Neat Things

- Graduating from AWS re/START bootcamp today! 3 months flies by quick when you're productive
- I'm investing in devops training ASAP (due by EOD)
- I think I found 2 really good job posts I'm a perfect fit for
- When you find work that engages you - go all in. Stop hesitating.

## Next Steps

- invest in devops training (due by EOD)
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again (mid january perhaps)
- ????
- profit
