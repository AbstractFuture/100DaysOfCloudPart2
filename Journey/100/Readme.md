# 200 Days In 

## Introduction

Thanks for sticking with me during this journey. 200 days ago I wasn't in tech. Now I'm an associate cloud operations engineer and moving across the country. Things will happen for you when you make them happen.

## Timelines

- begin my first run through of 100DaysOfCloud and begin learning linux
- sign up for the cloud bootcamp offerred by the Linux Foundation
- learned sysadmin skills from the cloud bootcamp so I can navigate servers
- quit my job so I can study full time
- apply and get accepted into the YES2TECH program, which delivered the AWS re/START Cloud Bootcamp to me remotely
- begin my second run of 100DaysOfCloud
- get AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certified
- sign up for dev ops/ python training from BeCloudReady
- create resume
- send out at least 100 messages to linkedin hiring managers over a period of a month
- revamp resume to be a single page, and include the improvements (as a % or $ figure that I contributed towards) and suddenly my response rate from employers goes WAAAAY up!
- write down and restudy all questions asked in technical interviews
- get hired 1 month after finishing the AWS cloud bootcamp

## Entitlement & Laziness - The Opportunity Killer

Many people, both in the bootcamp and on linkedin, reached out to me for advice. I assessed what action they had taken (how many recruiters did they reach out to per week, do they have a 1 page resume, do they have a github to display their cloud projects) and then I would check in with them in a week to see what changes they made to their behaviour.

I was surprised to see that most people made no changes! They didn't prepare a 1 page resume. They didn't reach out to anyone, they didn't create a github to display what they knew. 

When I got my offer from Cloudreach I was in the middle of 2 other technical interview pipelines. I contacted 2 people in the cloud bootcamp who I thought would be a good fit. I gave them the contact details, the link to apply, and told them every question I was asked in the technical interviews. I reached out to them a week later and they had taken no action on those leads.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. I hope these stories prove to be useful to you. I hope they remind you to take action.
