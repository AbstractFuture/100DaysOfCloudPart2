# First Automated Patching (Setbacks & Lessons Learned)

## Summary

- slight setbacks
    - tagged non compliant resources w/ ignore tag so that automated patching kicked off (shout out to team mates for their help in trouble shooting :) )
    - some automated backups failed due to timeout so I did those manually
    - my configuration to connect to some instances failed. I'll need to troubleshoot this in depth...

- lessons learned
    - create maintenance window earlier in the day
        - allows for other engineers to review my work
    - test out connection configuration earlier in the day
    - learned how to navigate the automated patching platform better

Overall, the outcome was successful! And it was very cool to take the lead on this! Looking forward to the next one.
