# Tinkering With CloudTrail

## Introduction

CloudTrail is a way to see who did what and when in your environment. You can learn more about CloudTrail [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/).

## Summary

Today I used CloudTrail to determine the time of an outage. CloudTrail presents the type of change made to a resource (in this case an ec2 instance) as well as the time and date of the change and who made the change. 

This information was used by me and a colleague to determine the cause and time of an outage. Cool stuff, I can definitely see why CloudTrail is so useful.
