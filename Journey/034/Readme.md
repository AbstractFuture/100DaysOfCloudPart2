# Technical Interview Recap

## Introduction

I'm looking forward to hearing back from the technical recruiter. No matter what the outcome is, nobody got anywhere without taking action and making an effort.

I wrote down what questions I was being asked and now I have a rough list of topics I need to be able to answer better.

## Multi Cloud

While I was screened and approved by the recruiter, the interview itself had quite a lot of Azure questions. I suppose I'll need to add a few good Azure tutorials to my study list and build some projects. 

## Next Steps

- compile list of questions asked in the technical interview for studying
- send out resume; schedule cloud interview
- complete python devops assessments
    - complete more HackerRank challenges
    - review other python tutorials
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
- ????
- profit
