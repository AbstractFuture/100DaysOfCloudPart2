#  AWS re/START Cloud Practitioner Practice Test Results

## Introduction

I have mixed feelings about the results. I'm averaging 70% on tests, which is the bare minimum to pass. I can't say I'm thrilled about my progress (or lack thereof), but I can say that I'm satisfied with my overall study strategy which I will further explain.

## Cloud Research

Wether I pass or fail the AWS CCP doesn't deter me from what I need to do:
- continue building a technical portfolio
- create an interview pipeline the same way I've created sales pipelines

Whatever happens, I'm better off today than I was yesterday.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Completed both the AWS re/START and Stephane Maarek Udemy AWS CCP tests. Now onto Neil Davis' practice tests and then redo Stephane's course.

## Next Steps

- studying for aws ccp
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
