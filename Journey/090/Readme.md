# IDP Days

## Introduction

Today I focused exclusively on the AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator exam review. 

At Cloudreach we have 2 full IDP days (Independent Development Plan) where we can study anything we like for a full day. Generally this has a specific focus on certification, especially for new hires, but can really encompass any topic that interests you. 

I really like this approach to work. Being an intensely curious person, this policy absolutely appeals to me. 

Once I finish the AZ-104 I'll begin working towards my AWS Solutions Architect cert.

## Next Steps

1) Earn meaningful professional certs
    - AZ 104 (Azure Administrator)
2) Daily Practice
    - Azure labs
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
