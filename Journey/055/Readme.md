# AWS CLI Cheatsheet (Link Included)

## Introduction

Today I reviewed AWS CLI commands, and reviewed my K8s learning path.

## AWS CLI Cheatsheet

TLDR; the cheatsheet is [here](https://dev.to/mdminhazulhaque/aws-cli-cheatsheet-15f2).

I've mentioned this before in other posts, but I highly recommend that you check out Aaron Brooks' youtube/ twitch channel and sign up for his free bootcamps.

He teaches devops, AWS cloud, programming concepts, python, go, linux, and more. Did I mention it was free? I also appreciate that his explanations and tutorials are stripped of buzzwords or jargon and I'm sure you'll appreciate that too.

Aaron, in his devops bootcamp, shared the link to the cheatsheet article with his students and I thought you might appreciate it, too.

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
    - continue Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.
