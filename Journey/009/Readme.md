# AWS Cloud Practitioner Study Plan

## Introduction

The study plan looks something like this;
- finish reviewing aws RE/start lecture slides (only a few more slides to go!)
- begin Stephane Maarek's udemy course for the AWS CCP
- take Neal Davis' aws ccp cloud practice tests (please please please check out his youtube channel! He's a very patient and articulate teacher)
- take my pearson vue aws ccp practice test on Dec 10th
- study as needed using Stephane's course based on these results
- take and pass the aws ccp

Personal Project Plan;
- finish all aws RE/start exercises/ projects and document it either in this #100DaysOfCloudPart2 repo or in a seperate repo
- add more complexity (like containerization) to my ci/cd pipeline (also I need to add an elastic IP to my tomcat server because jenkins required an IP address for my automated code deployer job. Without an elastic IP this is subject to change everytime the instance is restarted)
- perhaps build an entirely serverless ci/cd pipeline although this is the lowest priority thing on my mind at the moment

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

AWS:
- closer to passing the aws cloud practitioner exam (scheduled for Dec 17th!)

Personal Projects:
- a more developed project portfolio that I can leverage in interview

## Next Steps

- studying for aws ccp
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
