# Orientation / Training

## Introduction

Today I learned more about the services Cloudreach offers as well as continued the az-104 studying from acloudguru. 

## Use Case

Orientation included an overview of training for the next 4 weeks, a look at the leadership team, our expected deliverables, some history of the company (Cloudreach was acquired by the private equity firm blackstone, which is pretty neat! I wouldn't have known that if not for our very extroverted speaker) and who we can reach out to for help.

Overall: great day. Looking forward to the next 4 weeks!

## Cloud Research

I've completed about 30% of the az-104 content. I better start on the practice tests. 

## Next Steps
