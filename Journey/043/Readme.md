# Terraform, Freelancing, & Phone Pre-Screens

## Introduction

I've been setting myself up for success the last few days. Planning the next 2 weeks, scheduling interviews and appointments, checking over scopes of work, and continuing to build out my technical portfolio. All in all: if you don't take action you'll be stuck forever. 

## Terraform

- begin building out terraform VPC project
- finish moving terraform state file into aws s3 bucket

## Freelancing

- Need to follow up Monday

## Pre Screens

- do interview prep from 7-9 am Mon

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
    - begin Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.
