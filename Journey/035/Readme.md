# December's Cloud / Serverless Study Plan

## Introduction

I have a lot on my plate, I think its fair to say I should spend the weekend reorganizing my priorities and planning what the next month of study plan and interviewing should look like. 

## Current task List

- spend 1 hr revising my python devops solution
- spend 1 hr on my terraform project
- spend 1 hr on docker devops tasks
- spend 1 hr sending out resumes and scheduling interviews

## Next Steps

- build out serverless aws project
- build out terraform project
    - I should turn this project into a multicloud project!
- select and built out ansible project
- review list of questions asked in the technical interview for studying
    - research one thoroughly and practice answer
- send out resume; schedule cloud interview
- complete python devops assessments
    - review current python solution
        - add in comments so I don't forget what the code does
        - add additional test cases so I can determine if my solution is hard coded or properly algorithmic
    - review other python tutorials
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
- begin Aaron Brooks' pipelines and horizons bootcamp on Jan 4th
- ????
- profit
