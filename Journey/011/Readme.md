# AWS CCP Progress

## Introduction

The timeline is as follows;
- Dec 5 & 6 (this weekend): continue through Stephane's udemy AWS CCP lectures
- Dec 7: have AWS re/START Cloud Practitioner practice quiz
- Dec 8 & 9: continue through Stephane's udemy AWS CCP lectures, ensuring I repeatedly do all quizzes at the end of the lecture
- Dec 10: use AWS practice exam (one free voucher was given to me by the AWS re/START program). This will give me an idea how much study is required before I do the real exam
- Dec 11-16: study (depending on previous days results) or move onto other coding/ cloud projects
- Dec 17: take and pass the AWS CCP exam

## Cloud Research

At the moment I am about half way through Stephane's course. I think he is a good udemy instructor. He explains things will and gives a video walkthrough of provisioning the services he is lecturing about. 

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

At the end of this weekend I should be easily passing all of Stephane's end of lecture quizzes. Depending on how good my AWS re/START practice quiz score is, I can move onto other cloud projects.

## Next Steps

- studying for aws ccp
- integrate docker into the ci/cd project
- build more aws projects/ do aws exercises
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
