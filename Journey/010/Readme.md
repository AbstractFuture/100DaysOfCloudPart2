# VPC - Subnets in multiple availability zones

## Summary

Today I setup a VPC via the AWS Management Console. My goal was to assign this Private/Public VPC some additional subnets that would be in a different availability zone. My intent was to build on this exercise and offer services with high availability. 

I'm currently building out another repo to host some AWS exercises and projects to leverage that in interviews. The VPC details and configuration are listed in greater detail in there.

Aside from that, I continued using Stephane Maarek's Udemy course, and the AWS re/START study slides to review AWS services and prep for my AWS CCP online exam. Very excited to ace this exam!

## Next Steps
