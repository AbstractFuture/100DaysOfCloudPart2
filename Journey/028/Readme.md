# Cloud Resume Revamp (and interviewing!)

## Introduction

Today will definitely shape up to be a busy day. Here's the condensed task list;

- reduce resume to one page
    - reduce bullet points under work experience to be more concise, less intimidating, and easier to read (recruiters spend an avg. of 6 seconds looking at your resume, so make it count!)
- meet with other cloud engineers working in Toronto
    - I intend to learn about their day to day, what career growth looks like at their companies, and get a feel for how my skillset matches up
- send out updated 1 page resume to a recruiter who's waiting on it
    - definitely need to do this before 8am!
    - schedule an interview once that is sent out
- have remote cloud interview in the afternoon (job is in Vancouver so I may need to move there if I'm selected!)
- complete pthon exercises
- contact ryerson and obtain a copy of my project management certificate (I lost my physical copy earlier this year)

## Next Steps

- complete python devops assessments
    - complete more HackerRank challenges
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
- ????
- profit
