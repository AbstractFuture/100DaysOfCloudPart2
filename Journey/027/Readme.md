# New Python Challenge (Medium Difficulty)

## The Challenge

Write a function that takes an array of integers and places the zeroes in the center of the array. All non-zero integers should keep their relative position. For the purpose of this question, center is defined as floor(length of array / 2). center_zeros([1, 1, 3, 0, 6, 0]) -> [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 6]

While my code passed 4/5 test cases, it failed the above array as a test case. My code didn't account for there being more than one zero, and my code exits the for loop once the first occurence of zero is found. 

This indicates to me that my python fundamentals are not where they need to be. I need to design a solution that continues looping through each element of the array, even after a zero is found. I'll reflect more on that today.

I'll also be going over more python tutorials (from HackerRank and perhaps elsewhere) so I can learn better loop conditionals.

Feel free to try writing your own code to solve the above array. I'd be curious to see how you solved it!

Aside from that, I'll be sending out another few custom resumes.

I've also reduced my resume to a single page and I'd like to see if my response rate increases as a result.

## Next Steps

- complete python devops assessments
    - complete more HackerRank challenges
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again (mid January perhaps)
- ????
- profit
