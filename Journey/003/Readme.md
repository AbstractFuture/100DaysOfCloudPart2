# Rinse & Repeat - Studying For The CKA

## Introduction

The most valuable thing I learned from preparing for the LFCS exam was how repitition helped me stay fast, solve problems, and ask the right questions.

The CKA, like the LFCS, is a practicle hands on exam. While it is open book (you can have the kubernetes docs open in a single tab), it would be beneficial to you in a timed exam to have enough fundamental knowledge such that you don't need to rely on searching the the documentation every 30 seconds. 

You'll only have 2 hours to complete the CKA - so being fast, intelligently troubleshooting, and moving on from questions that seem too difficult so that you can complete easier tasks, are all critical to passing. 

It should come as no surprise then that I am speedrunning labs over and over again until I no longer need to rely on documentation. I've also scheduled the CKA for Dec 5th.

## Prerequisite

Before starting the CKA prep, I completed kodeklouds docker for beginners and kubernetes for beginners course. It isn't much content, so I recommend starting there.

## Cloud Research

Today focused on doing labs regarding;
- daemonsets
- custom schedulers
- monitoring cluster components
- application logs
- rolling updates and rollbacks
- commands and arguments in kubernetes
- configuring environment variables

## Try yourself

I used kodekloud to learn about docker and kubernetes. I leave it up to you to determine if that is the right resource for yourself.

## Next Steps

- study and pass the cka
- study and pass the aws ccp
- build devops projects
- enter the job market
