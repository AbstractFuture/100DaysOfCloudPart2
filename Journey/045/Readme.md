# Interviews On Interviews

## Introduction

I'm very glad I've created sales pipelines from scratch before, because now the interview requests are really starting to increase!

When I get hired I'll detail a list of companies I interviewed with in the past 30 days or so.

This week is booked with confirmed interviews and next week is booked with tentative time slots. Looking forward to it!

## The Standard Procedure

Generally the process has been like so:
- phone screen
- technical interview
- culture fit interview

Thus far all phone pre screens went well and were friendly, and even the technical interviews, while challenging, were fun and good. 

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
    - continue Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.
