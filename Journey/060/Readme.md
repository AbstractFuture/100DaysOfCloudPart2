# Interview Questions (Part 3)

## Introduction

Interview questions continued.

## Questions

- tell me about yourself
    - I was asked this in every interview. You better get your pitch down. Practice in a mirror. Record yourself and rewatch it. What did you articulate well and where was there confusion in your pitch? This part is critical. It is always asked at the beginning and sets the tone for the remainder of the interview.
- what is route53 and where does it get its name from?
- what is the difference between an AMI and a snapshot?
- what are the differences between cloudtrail and cloudwatch?
- what is iis?
