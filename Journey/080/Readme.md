# BeCloudReady DevOps Training Review

## Introduction

Below is the review I posted in the private slack group for the BeCloudReady DevOps training program (google it). Overall it is a high quality program that will set you on the right path to break into cloud.

I'm not being paid for my review - this is just my honest opinion about my experience with them!

## The Review

```
Hey Everyone,
I hope you are all doing well. I wanted to post a review of my experience with the BeCloudReady team.

I should say that like anything else; you get out whatever you put in. Don't sign up and then be haphazard about it. Commit to taking daily action. The daily zoom meetings are an excellent chance to grow your skillset and get specific feedback about your progress. Make use of this opportunity!

During the zoom meetings I had the chance to ask specific questions, present my code to a technical audience, explain my process for breaking down a technical problem into smaller tasks, and I left every zoom meeting with clear next steps based on instructor feedback.

When a student demonstrates they can think about problems in this manner, the likelihood of getting a freelance contract from the BeCloudReady team is highly likely. So be consistent and show up for those zoom meetings! It is a valuable resource that will allow you to build real world experience that will help you land and pass technical interviews.

I hope this review has been helpful! The DevOps field is growing fast and I am sure you will find well paying and highly interesting work. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions you have on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-aranibar).

Best,
Steven Aranibar
