# CKA Security Concepts & Labs

## Introduction

Today I started the security section of the CKA content, but for whatever reason, kodekloud does not include video solutions to these labs. Personally I found this section very hard to sovle and follow along with. 

For the remainder of the day I intend to speedrun all labs completed thus far (I suspect this will take up most of the study time I have today) and try to progress further in the security section. 

If anyone has found a better series that details kubernetes security concepts, please reach out to me! 

## Prerequisite

Some basic knowledge of kubernetes is required before doing kodeklouds CKA prep course.

## Next Steps

- speedrun all previous labs
- finish CKA security labs
- complete all cka content
- pass cka
- study for and pass the aws ccp

## Social Proof
