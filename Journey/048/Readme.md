# Phase 3 Interviews

## Introduction

Had my first phase 3 (final round) interview with a cloud company. Whether or not I get the job, I can say it was a great experience. Both interviewers were very competent and friendly. It's very exciting to think I may have the chance to work with and learn from really great people.

## Interview Topics

The interview questions, while technical, were more focused on how I solve problems. It seemed to me that my interviewers were more interested in the sort of questions I would ask and what sort of evidence I would seek out in my problem solving process. 

I was also asked about what sorts of knowldege gaps I have and how I intended to overcome this. I am actually very thankful for that question because it gave me a chance to explain how I was preparing for this phase 3 interview after completing the phase 2 technical interview.

My process during phase 2 was as follows;
- write down every question I struggled with
- review question and research answers 1 hour per day

Then I simply explained which cluster of phase 2 interview questions stumped me, and what I've learned since then. All in all - they seemed to appreciate the go getter attitude. Always be learning.

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
    - continue Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.
