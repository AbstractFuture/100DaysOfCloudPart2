# Interview Pipeline & Task List

## Introduction

Very glad that I have cold calling and sales pipeline experience prior to learning cloud. I'm averaging 2 interviews per week because of that experience, and learning more about what sorts of questions are asked in interviews.

I have at least 2 more interviews currently scheduled for this week and I can feel I'm getting close to landing my first role!

## Task List For Today

- 1 hour of reviewing cloud interview questions
- kubernetes internship
- terraform project
- send out updated resume

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily

2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
