# Project Progress - Jenkins Server Setup

## Introduction

I'll be postponing my CKA studies until developing at least 1 portfolio project to put on my resume and getting the AWS CCP. 

If all goes well I'll have this completed by Dec 17th where I intend to use the remainder of the month to reach out to companies and also prep for the CKA.

## Cloud Research

I've setup an ec2 instance, created the appropraite .pem keys and changed the hostname such that I can easily tell which server I'm in. I've installed java and set up the appropriate variables in my .bash_profile to easily reference them in my jenkins configuration.

I've also added maven and github as plugins for jenkins.

I also set up a test jenkins job which ran successfully. 

Progress is sometimes slow, but hey, slow and steady will outpace enthusiastic and unrigorous. 

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Part one of this ci/cd pipeline is now established. Let's keep it moving! Onto the next part.

## Next Steps

- setup apache tomcat server
- study for aws ccp
- send out my resume
- begin cka prep again
- ????
- profit
