# Interview Questions

## Introduction

I thought you might benefit from hearing some of the questions I was asked in my journey.

I would recommend that as you study the answers to these questions (I don't intend to spoonfeed you answers - take some inintiative!) that you reach out to people already employed as cloud engineers in your city. I reached out to 5 cloud engineers a day and asked if they had 30 mins to chat. Many people are surprisingly generous with their time and very much enjoy helping out people breaking into tech. Ask these engineers questions like:
- what do you think of my technical projects? 
- what would you change about my technical projects?
- if you were/are a hiring manager, what is one thing I can do to stand out?
- ask any confusing technical questions you find here in this series because you will be given expert level answers!

## Questions

    - what is an advantage of using jenkins?
    - what are jenkins paramaters?

## Next Steps

1) Land a cloud role (top tier priority)
    - review cloud technical interview questions daily, practice better answers, get ready for the next interview rounds
    - contact hiring managers and send out resumes daily
    - continue Aaron Brooks' free devops bootcamp assignments
2) Earn meaningful professional certs (mid tier priority)
    - Terraform associate (1hr practice per day)
    - CKA (postponed until step one is complete)
3) Daily Practice (mid tier priority)
    - daily python
    - #100DaysOfCloud daily documenting
4) Complete AWS projects (mid tier)
    - serverless
    - ansible w/ ec2
5) Complete ci/cd pipeline proj (low tier)
    - with my current technical interview experience, no questions were asked about ci/cd or jenkins. This is now a low tier priority.
