# Technical Interview Prep

## Introduction

After my round 1 pre screen, I was authorized to move forward with a technical interview. As I understand it, this will be an hour of questions about cloud services (although I have a stronger focus on AWS I may need to review some microsoft cloud offerings).

My day will mainly consist of interview prep, study, and applying to at least one job with a custom resume and cover letter.
