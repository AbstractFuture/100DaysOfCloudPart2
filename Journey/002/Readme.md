# Kubernetes Practice Tests

## Introduction

Today I'll be redoing my kubernetes labs thus far and continuing with the CKA studying.

## Prerequisite

Some basic knowledge of linux (like how to navigate in a terminal) and some basic knowledge of kubernetes (like what business problem is kubernetes solving).

## Cloud Research

I'm currently finishing up learning about logging and monitoring before moving onto the application lifecycle management section of the CKA. After that, I have about 60% of study content remaining.

## Try yourself

✍️ Add a mini tutorial to encourage the reader to get started learning something new about the cloud.

## Next Steps

- Finish CKA exam prep
- Get CKA cert
- Schedule and pass the AWS CCP
- Build devops project
- Enter the Toronto job market
